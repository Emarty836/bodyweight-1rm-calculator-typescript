# bodyweight-1rm-calculator

This was edited with some Typscript, Vanilla JS, HTML, and Vanilla CSS

The purpose of this calculator is to help predict your maximum weight lifted per repititons up to 20 with bodyweight exercises per weight.  When doing bodyweight exercises such as pullups, pushups, dips, etc. the one reps max is based roughly on both your own bodyweight and the additional weight.  It can also work for regular lifts such as bench press if you leave the bodyweight at 0.
